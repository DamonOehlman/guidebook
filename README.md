# guidebook

The `guidebook` module (and CLI) is a simple way to enable interaction with
your markdown sources for a [leanpub](https://leanpub.com) authored books
with an interactive guidebook.  This approach has been developed for working
with the [rtc.io](http://rtc.io/) modules and as such uses a browser based
interface.

## Why?

Because I don't like doing things more than once, and it seemed like most of
the component pieces were available to make this possible.

## Usage

Once you have installed guidebook on your local machine, then you should be
able to run the `guidebook` command in a leanpub compatible folder.
